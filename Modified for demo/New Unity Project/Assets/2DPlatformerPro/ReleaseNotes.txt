Version History
----------------

1.2.3

 * Added Unity 2017.2 support.

1.2.2

 * Added Unity 2017.1 support.

1.2.1

 * Model Direction facer updated to work with enemy.

 * Updated EventResponder for ItemEvents to use the amount sent as part of event instead of amount in the ItemManagaer. UPGRADE NOTE: Double check your item event conditions.

 * Updates for Unity 5.5 to avoid warnings in console.

 * Cleaned up persistence for ActivationGroups. They can now be more easily used to create powers that last for an entire game, or even across games (for example IAP).

 * Extra options for activation group (e.g. Can Click When Paused).

 * FIX: for CANCEL style combo attacks.

 * FIX: for attack events not being sent or not having full details.

 * SAMPLE REMOVAL: The 2.5D Stealth sample was very large and seldom referenced, it has been removed. 

1.2.0

* CommandBro sample now supports multiple, switchable weapons with example of flame thrower and shotgun.

* New and improved swimming movement with breath.

* Editor Updates for Unity 5.4.x ... as a side effect we now have much more undo support :)

* Block movement. Press a button to block attacks with variations for high/low/etc.

* New ActivationGroup which allow you to make all kinds of cool stuff such as mutli-state puzzles, weapon systems (see above), etc.

* Added an option to make additional conditions on platforms either apply or ignore collisions (previously it always applied when condition met).

* Small updates to the 2-player CommandBro sample variation.

* Added simple landing movement to make it easier to play landing states. Also added a variation which causes damage.

* Added a movement for climbing across ceilings (horizontally). You can also use for ropes and similar by setting the climb up value to false and using a layer that is not in the geometry layer.

* FIX: Combo attacks now properly respect the button input window. UPGRADE NOTE: you maay need to reviews your combo settings.

* FIX: Fixed float movement so it works again.


1.1.5

* Updated CharacterLoader to better support selectable characters and multi-player.

* Simplified the creation of power-ups which affect available movements (using new PowerUpConditions).

* Added a RailPlatform which locks player to a 'rail' with many options to control how the player moves on rail (e.g. create a mining cart).

* Cleaned up some Character methods to simplify development of highly custom movements. UPGRADE NOTE: This may affect your custom movement that rely on checking or applying collisions manually.

* Added two new wall movements: wall run and wall climb.

* Fix: Waypoint mover one-off re-enable no longer causes errors.
